# 2048 Game 🎮

A simple implementation of the classic **2048 sliding puzzle game** built with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript**.  
Move tiles on a 4×4 grid to combine them and reach the **2048 tile**!

## 🔍 About

2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game where you slide numbered tiles on a grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two values. The goal is to reach the tile with **2048** (and beyond if you wish!). 
This repo contains a simple web implementation of the game that you can play in your browser or run locally.
